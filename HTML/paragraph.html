        Given string str, find the length of the longest repeating subsequence
        such that it can be found twice in the given string. The two identified 
        subsequences A and B can use the same ith character from string str if
        <br>
        and only if that ith character has different indices in A and B. For example,
        A = "xax" and B = "xax" then the index of first "x" must be different in the 
        original string for A and B.
